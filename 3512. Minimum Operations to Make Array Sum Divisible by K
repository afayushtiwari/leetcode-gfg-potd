3512. Minimum Operations to Make Array Sum Divisible by K
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,9,7], k = 5

Output: 4

Explanation:

Perform 4 operations on nums[1] = 9. Now, nums = [3, 5, 7].
The sum is 15, which is divisible by 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,3], k = 4

Output: 0

Explanation:

The sum is 8, which is already divisible by 4. Hence, no operations are needed.
//SOLUTION
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            sum+=nums[i];

        }
        return sum%k;
        
        
    }
};

//Hint
check sum%k;
